Q: Trevor Bauer will look to repeat as the NL Cy Young Award winner with a new team. 
Only one pitcher in history has ever won back-to-back Cy Youngs with different teams. Who is he?

Code:

SELECT FirstAward.fullName, FirstAward.yearID, FirstAward.name, SecondAward.yearID, SecondAward.name
FROM(
SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, AwardsPlayers.yearID, Teams.teamID, Teams.name
FROM (((People
INNER JOIN Pitching
ON People.playerID = Pitching.playerID)
INNER JOIN Teams
ON Pitching.teamID = Teams.teamID AND Pitching.yearID = Teams.yearID)
INNER JOIN AwardsPlayers
ON Pitching.playerID = AwardsPlayers.playerID AND Pitching.yearID = AwardsPlayers.yearID)
WHERE AwardsPlayers.awardID = "Cy Young Award") AS FirstAward
INNER JOIN(
SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, AwardsPlayers.yearID, Teams.teamID, Teams.name
FROM (((People
INNER JOIN Pitching
ON People.playerID = Pitching.playerID)
INNER JOIN Teams
ON Pitching.teamID = Teams.teamID AND Pitching.yearID = Teams.yearID)
INNER JOIN AwardsPlayers
ON Pitching.playerID = AwardsPlayers.playerID AND Pitching.yearID = AwardsPlayers.yearID)
WHERE AwardsPlayers.awardID = "Cy Young Award") AS SecondAward
ON FirstAward.playerID = SecondAward.playerID AND FirstAward.yearID = SecondAward.yearID - 1 AND FirstAward.teamID <> SecondAward.teamID
