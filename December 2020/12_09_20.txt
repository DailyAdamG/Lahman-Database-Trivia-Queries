Q: Only two pitchers born in the past 50 years have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Who are they?

Code:

SELECT DISTINCT People.playerID, People.nameFirst, People.nameLast
FROM ((People
INNER JOIN Pitching
ON People.playerID = Pitching.playerID)
INNER JOIN HallOfFame
ON Pitching.playerID = HallOfFame.playerID)
WHERE People.birthYear >= 1970 AND HallOfFame.inducted = "Y"

A: Pedro Martinez (born 1971) and Roy Halladay (born 1977)

*Roy Halladay does not appear, because the Hall Of Fame Class is only up to date through 2018 at the moment.
