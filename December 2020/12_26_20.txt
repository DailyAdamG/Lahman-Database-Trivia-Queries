Code:

SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, Pitching.yearID, Teams.name
FROM ((People
INNER JOIN Pitching
ON People.playerID = Pitching.playerID)
INNER JOIN Teams
ON Pitching.yearID = Teams.yearID AND Pitching.teamID = Teams.teamID)
WHERE Pitching.W >= 20 AND Teams.L >= 100 AND Teams.Rank >= 8

A: Ned Garver, 1951 St. Louis Browns (Orioles)
