SELECT DISTINCT Seventies.playerID, Seventies.fullName
FROM(
SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName
FROM People
INNER JOIN Managers

FROM People
INNER JOIN Managers
ON People.playerID = Managers.playerID
WHERE Managers.yearID >= 1980 AND Managers.yearID < 1990) AS Eighties

INNER JOIN
(SELECT People.playerID
FROM People
INNER JOIN Managers
ON People.playerID = Managers.playerID
WHERE Managers.yearID >= 1990 AND Managers.yearID < 2000) AS Nineties
