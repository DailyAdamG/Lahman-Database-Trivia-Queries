Q: Yoán Moncada's 50 home runs are already third-most by a switch-hitter in White Sox history. Who is No. 1?

Code:

SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, SUM(Batting.HR) AS CHW_HR
FROM ((People
INNER JOIN Batting
ON People.playerID = Batting.playerID)
INNER JOIN Teams
ON Batting.teamID = Teams.teamID AND Batting.yearID = Teams.yearID)
WHERE People.bats = "B" AND Teams.name = "Chicago White Sox"
GROUP BY People.playerID, People.nameFirst, People.nameLast
ORDER BY SUM(Batting.HR) DESC

A: José Valentín (136 home runs from 2000-04)
