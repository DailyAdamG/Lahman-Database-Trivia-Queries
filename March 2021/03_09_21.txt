Q: Six of the last seven NL batting titles have been won by left-handed hitters. Who was the lone right-hander in that group?

Code:

SELECT Players.fullName, Players.bats, Players.yearID, Leaders.BA
FROM(
SELECT Batting.yearID, MAX(ROUND(Batting.H/Batting.AB,4)) AS BA
FROM Batting
WHERE IIF(Batting.yearID < 2020, (Batting.AB + Batting.BB + Batting.HBP + Batting.SF + Batting.SH) >= 501, (Batting.AB + Batting.BB + Batting.HBP + Batting.SF + Batting.SH) >= 186) AND Batting.lgID = "NL" AND Batting.yearID >= 2014
GROUP BY Batting.yearID) AS Leaders
INNER JOIN(
SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, People.bats, Batting.yearID, ROUND(Batting.H/Batting.AB,4) AS BA
FROM People
INNER JOIN Batting
ON People.playerID = Batting.playerID
WHERE IIF(Batting.yearID < 2020, (Batting.AB + Batting.BB + Batting.HBP + Batting.SF + Batting.SH) >= 501, (Batting.AB + Batting.BB + Batting.HBP + Batting.SF + Batting.SH) >= 186) AND Batting.lgID = "NL" AND Batting.yearID >= 2014) AS Players
ON Leaders.yearID = Players.yearID AND Leaders.BA = Players.BA
ORDER BY Players.yearID DESC
