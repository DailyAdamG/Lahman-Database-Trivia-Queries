Code:

SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, SUM(Batting.HR) AS HR, SUM(Batting.RBI) AS RBI, ROUND(SUM(Batting.H / Batting.AB),3) AS BA
FROM ((People
INNER JOIN Batting
ON People.playerID = Batting.playerID)
INNER JOIN Fielding
ON Batting.yearID = Fielding.yearID AND Batting.playerID = Fielding.playerID AND Batting.stint = Fielding.stint)
WHERE Fielding.POS = "SS" AND Fielding.GS >= 10 AND Batting.yearID = 2019
GROUP BY People.playerID, People.nameFirst, People.nameLast
HAVING SUM(Batting.HR) >= 30 AND SUM(Batting.RBI) >= 100 AND ROUND(SUM(Batting.H / Batting.AB),3) >= .3

A: Boston's Xander Bogaerts (.309, 33, 117)
