Q: Who are the only two pitchers to retire with at least 300 wins, 3,000 strikeouts and an ERA below 3.00?

Code:

SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, SUM(Pitching.W) AS CareerW, SUM(Pitching.SO) AS CareerK, ROUND(((SUM(Pitching.ER) * 9) / (SUM(IPouts)/3)),2) AS CareerERA
FROM People
INNER JOIN Pitching
ON People.playerID = Pitching.playerID
GROUP BY People.playerID, People.nameFirst, People.nameLast
HAVING SUM(Pitching.W) >= 300 AND SUM(Pitching.SO) >= 3000 AND ((SUM(Pitching.ER) * 9) / (SUM(IPouts)/3)) < 3
ORDER BY SUM(Pitching.W) DESC

A: Walter Johnson (417 W, 3,509 SO, 2.17 ERA) and Tom Seaver (311 W, 3,640 SO, 2.86 ERA)
