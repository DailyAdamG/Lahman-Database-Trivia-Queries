Code:

SELECT PlayerList.playerID, PlayerList.fullName, COUNT(PlayerList.yearID) AS BattingCrowns
FROM(
SELECT PlayerList.playerID, PlayerList.fullName, PlayerList.lgID, PlayerList.yearID, PlayerList.BA
FROM(
SELECT Batting.yearID, Batting.lgID, MAX(ROUND(Batting.H/Batting.AB,3)) AS BA 
FROM People 
INNER JOIN Batting 
ON People.playerID = Batting.playerID 
WHERE (Batting.AB + Batting.BB + Batting.HBP + Batting.SF + Batting.SH) >= 502
GROUP BY Batting.yearID, Batting.lgID) AS BALeaders
INNER JOIN(
SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, Batting.lgID, Batting.yearID, ROUND(Batting.H/Batting.AB,3) AS BA
FROM People
INNER JOIN Batting
ON People.playerID = Batting.playerID
WHERE (Batting.AB + Batting.BB + Batting.HBP + Batting.SF + Batting.SH) >= 502 AND People.bats = "B") AS PlayerList
ON BALeaders.yearID = PlayerList.yearID AND BALeaders.BA = PlayerList.BA AND BALeaders.lgID = PlayerList.lgID) AS BothTables
GROUP BY PlayerList.playerID, PlayerList.fullName
HAVING COUNT(PlayerList.yearID) >= 2
ORDER BY COUNT(PlayerList.yearID) DESC
