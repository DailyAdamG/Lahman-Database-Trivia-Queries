Q: Before this year, when was the last time both MVPs were first basemen?

Code:

SELECT AL.yearID, AL.fullName, NL.fullName
FROM(
SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, AwardsPlayers.yearID
FROM ((People
INNER JOIN Fielding
ON People.playerID = Fielding.playerID)
INNER JOIN AwardsPlayers
ON Fielding.yearID = AwardsPlayers.yearID AND Fielding.playerID = AwardsPlayers.playerID)
WHERE Fielding.POS = "1B" AND Fielding.GS >= 25 AND AwardsPlayers.lgID = "AL" AND AwardsPlayers.awardID = "Most Valuable Player") AS AL
INNER JOIN(
SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, AwardsPlayers.yearID
FROM ((People
INNER JOIN Fielding
ON People.playerID = Fielding.playerID)
INNER JOIN AwardsPlayers
ON Fielding.yearID = AwardsPlayers.yearID AND Fielding.playerID = AwardsPlayers.playerID)
WHERE Fielding.POS = "1B" AND Fielding.GS >= 25 AND AwardsPlayers.lgID = "NL" AND AwardsPlayers.awardID = "Most Valuable Player") AS NL
ON AL.yearID = NL.yearID
ORDER BY AL.yearID DESC
