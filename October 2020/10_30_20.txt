Q: How many future Hall of Famers did Tony La Russa manage with the White Sox from 1979-86?

Code:

SELECT DISTINCT HOF.playerID, HOF.fullName
FROM(
SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName
FROM People
INNER JOIN HallOfFame
ON People.playerID = HallOfFame.playerID
WHERE HallOfFame.inducted = "Y" AND HallOfFame.category = "Player") AS HOF
INNER JOIN(
SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName
FROM ((People
INNER JOIN Batting
ON People.playerID = Batting.playerID)
INNER JOIN Teams
ON Batting.teamID = Teams.teamID AND Batting.yearID = Teams.yearID)
WHERE Teams.name = "Chicago White Sox" AND Teams.yearID BETWEEN 1979 AND 1986) AS WhiteSoxPlayers
ON HOF.playerID = WhiteSoxPlayers.playerID

A: Three: Harold Baines (1980-86), Carlton Fisk (1981-86) and Tom Seaver (1984-86)

*Note Lahman Database does not include Harold Baines as an inducted member. 
Steve Carlton was acquired by the White Sox in the LaRussa's final year, but after Tony LaRussa was relieved
of his managerial duties.
