Q: Who is the last switch-hitter to lead the NL in home runs in a season?

Code:

SELECT PlayerList.playerID, PlayerList.fullName, HRTotals.yearID, HRTotals.HR
FROM (SELECT Batting.yearID, MAX(Batting.HR) AS HR 
FROM Batting 
WHERE Batting.lgID ="NL" GROUP BY Batting.yearID)  AS HRTotals 
INNER JOIN (
SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, Batting.yearID, Batting.HR 
FROM People 
INNER JOIN Batting 
ON People.playerID = Batting.playerID 
WHERE Batting.lgID = "NL" AND People.bats = "B")  AS PlayerList 
ON (HRTotals.HR = PlayerList.HR) AND (HRTotals.yearID = PlayerList.yearID)
ORDER BY HRTotals.yearID DESC;
