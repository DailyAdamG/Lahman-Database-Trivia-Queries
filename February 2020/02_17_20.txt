SELECT People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, SUM(Batting.SB) AS SB, SUM(Batting.CS) AS CS, ROUND((SUM(Batting.SB) / (SUM(Batting.SB) + SUM(Batting.CS)) * 100),1) AS SB_PCT
FROM People
INNER JOIN Batting
ON People.playerID = Batting.playerID
WHERE Batting.yearID >= 2017
GROUP BY People.nameFirst, People.nameLast
HAVING SUM(Batting.SB) >= 50 AND ROUND((SUM(Batting.SB) / (SUM(Batting.SB) + SUM(Batting.CS)) * 100),1) = 81.7
