Q: Which two players with the same name -- one of them a Hall of Famer -- hit the most combined homers?

Code:

SELECT HRTable.fullName, HRTable.HR
FROM(
SELECT People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, SUM(Batting.HR) AS HR
FROM People
INNER JOIN Batting
ON People.playerID = Batting.playerID
GROUP BY People.nameFirst, People.nameLast) AS HRTable
INNER JOIN(
SELECT People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, COUNT(People.playerID) AS Players
FROM People
GROUP BY People.nameFirst, People.nameLast
HAVING COUNT(People.playerID) = 2) AS ComboTable
ON HRTable.fullName = ComboTable.fullName
ORDER BY HRTable.HR DESC

A: Hall of Famer Frank E. Thomas (521 HRs from 1990-2008) and Frank J. Thomas (286 HRs from 1951-66) combined for 807 home runs
