Q: Which team was the last to have back-to-back MVP Award winners -- but won by different players?

Code:

SELECT FirstTable.fullName AS FirstWinner, FirstTable.yearID AS FirstYear, SecondTable.fullName AS SecondWinner, SecondTable.yearID AS SecondYear, FirstTable.name AS Team
FROM(
SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, Batting.yearID, Teams.name
FROM (((People
INNER JOIN Batting
ON People.playerID = Batting.playerID)
INNER JOIN Teams
ON Batting.yearID = Teams.yearID AND Batting.teamID = Teams.teamID)
INNER JOIN AwardsPlayers
ON Batting.playerID = AwardsPlayers.playerID AND Batting.yearID = AwardsPlayers.yearID)
WHERE AwardsPlayers.awardID = "Most Valuable Player") AS FirstTable
INNER JOIN(
SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, Batting.yearID, Teams.name
FROM (((People
INNER JOIN Batting
ON People.playerID = Batting.playerID)
INNER JOIN Teams
ON Batting.yearID = Teams.yearID AND Batting.teamID = Teams.teamID)
INNER JOIN AwardsPlayers
ON Batting.playerID = AwardsPlayers.playerID AND Batting.yearID = AwardsPlayers.yearID)
WHERE AwardsPlayers.awardID = "Most Valuable Player") AS SecondTable
ON FirstTable.yearID = SecondTable.yearID - 1 AND FirstTable.name = SecondTable.name AND FirstTable.playerID <> SecondTable.playerID
ORDER BY SecondTable.yearID DESC

A: The Detroit Tigers (Justin Verlander in 2011, Miguel Cabrera in 2012)
