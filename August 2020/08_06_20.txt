FROM(
SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, SUM(Batting.HR) AS CareerHR
FROM People
INNER JOIN Batting

HAVING SUM(Batting.HR) < 100) AS HRTable
INNER JOIN(
SELECT HallOfFame.playerID, HallOfFame.yearid
FROM HallOfFame
WHERE HallOfFame.inducted = "Y" AND HallOfFame.category = "Player" AND HallOfFame.votedBy = "BBWAA") AS HOFTable
ON HRTable.playerID = HOFTable.playerID) AS FirstTwoTables
INNER JOIN(
SELECT HallOfFame.playerID, MIN(HallOfFame.yearid) AS FirstBallot
