Q: Before Stephen Strasburg this year, who was the most recent pitcher to be named World Series MVP?

Code:

SELECT People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, AwardsPlayers.yearID, Teams.name
FROM (((People 
INNER JOIN Pitching 
ON People.playerID = Pitching.playerID)
INNER JOIN Teams
ON Pitching.teamID = Teams.teamID AND Pitching.yearID = Teams.yearID) 
INNER JOIN AwardsPlayers 
ON (Pitching.playerID = AwardsPlayers.playerID) AND (Pitching.yearID = AwardsPlayers.yearID))
WHERE AwardsPlayers.awardID = "World Series MVP"
ORDER BY AwardsPlayers.yearID DESC;
