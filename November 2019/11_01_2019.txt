Q: Who is the only manager other than Mike Matheny to manage both the Cardinals and Royals?

Code:

SELECT KC.fullName
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, Teams.name
FROM (People
INNER JOIN Managers 
ON People.playerID = Managers.playerID) 
INNER JOIN Teams 
ON Managers.teamID = Teams.teamID 
WHERE Teams.name = "Kansas City Royals")  AS KC 
INNER JOIN 
(SELECT DISTINCT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, Teams.name 
FROM (People 
INNER JOIN Managers 
ON People.playerID = Managers.playerID) 
INNER JOIN Teams 
ON Managers.teamID = Teams.teamID 
WHERE Teams.name = "St. Louis Cardinals")  AS STL ON KC.playerID=STL.playerID;
