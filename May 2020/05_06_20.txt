Q: In 1955, Willie Mays led the NL in home runs and triples and Mickey Mantle did the same in the AL. 
Who is the only player since then to lead a league in both categories in the same season?

Code:

SELECT Leaders.yearID, Players.playerID, Players.fullName
FROM(
SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, Batting.yearID, Batting.[3B], Batting.HR
FROM People
INNER JOIN Batting
ON People.playerID = Batting.playerID) AS Players
INNER JOIN(
SELECT Batting.yearID, Batting.lgID, MAX(Batting.[3B]) AS TripleLeader, MAX(Batting.HR) AS HRLeader
FROM Batting
WHERE Batting.yearID >= 1956
GROUP BY Batting.yearID, Batting.lgID) AS Leaders
ON (Players.yearID = Leaders.yearID) AND (Players.yearID AND Leaders.TripleLeader = Players.[3B]) AND (Leaders.HRLeader = Players.HR)

A: Jim Rice of the Red Sox, 1978
