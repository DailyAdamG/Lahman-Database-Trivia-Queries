Q: Who is the most recent rookie to be named World Series MVP?

Code:

SELECT Rookies.fullName, Rookies.RookieYear
FROM(
SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, MIN(Batting.YearID) AS RookieYear
FROM People
INNER JOIN Batting
ON People.playerID = Batting.playerID
GROUP BY People.playerID, People.nameFirst, People.nameLast) AS Rookies
INNER JOIN(
SELECT AwardsPlayers.playerID, AwardsPlayers.yearID
FROM AwardsPlayers
WHERE AwardsPlayers.awardID = "World Series MVP") AS WSList
ON Rookies.playerID = WSList.playerID AND (Rookies.RookieYear + 1) = WSList.yearID
ORDER BY Rookies.RookieYear DESC

A: The Marlins' Liván Hernández (1997)

*Needed to add RookieYear + 1, since Livan Hernandez debuted in 1996 and was still rookie eligible in 1997.
