Q: Which two players share the record for most home runs by a right-handed hitter in his age-40 season or older?

Code:

SELECT People.playerID, People.nameFirst & " " & People.nameLast AS fullName, Batting.yearID, SUM(Batting.HR) AS HR
FROM People
INNER JOIN Batting
ON People.playerID = Batting.playerID
WHERE IIF(People.birthMonth < 7, (Batting.yearID - People.birthYear), (Batting.yearID - People.birthYear - 1)) >= 40 AND People.bats = "R"
GROUP BY People.playerID, People.nameFirst, People.nameLast, Batting.yearID
ORDER BY SUM(Batting.HR) DESC

A: Dave Winfield (26 HRs at age 40 for the Blue Jays in 1992) and Hank Sauer (26 HRs, also at 40, for the Giants in 1957)
